# Technologies

# Notes / Improvements

- The project currently uses a single static DB connection — using a connection pool is recommended for production.

- Input validation is minimal — consider adding server-side and client-side validation.

- Search functionality in the navbar is not implemented yet.

- UI styling can be enhanced using custom CSS.

-  I know that JSP and Servlets are older Java technologies, but I built this project to understand how they work behind the scenes. It helped me see how Java handles web requests, manages data, and serves dynamic content. My goal was to learn the basics of Java web development and gain a better understanding of how early Java web frameworks functioned.
